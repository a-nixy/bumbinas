## Game Guide!~

- 1- You are given an 8 x 8 playing field on which sit 3 colored balls: green, blue, and red.

- 2- When you click on a ball, you have selected it and can now move it around the board and place it in an empty space.

- 3- Each time a ball is moved, the field spawns a random number of balls in random spots.

- 4- The aim of the game is to match 5 balls of the same color horizontally or vertically to clear them and continue playing.

- !- Note: If a ball spawns in a spot and completes a row of 5, the balls will not be cleared â€” only rows created by the player are cleared!

- 5- Once the field is full and no more balls can be moved or spawned, the game ends.

*Have fun!~*
